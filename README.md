# Moidom
Moidom is my first homework for a Computer Graphics course in University. <br />

The assignment was to create walls (some of them with holes for windows and doors) for at least 4 rooms based on the given template that was randomly generated for the different faculty numbers. <br />
Part of the assignment was to create two mandatory objects, different for every person, for me personally they were a guitar and a radiator. I decided to go beyond that and created furniture for all 4 rooms. <br />

# Warning
To all the students from my university who happen to look at the project, you are now officially warned that you'll most likely be caught if you decide to copy my code and submit it as yours as most of our assignments are tested for plagiarism and saved for some period of time.
