# Moidom
Moidom is my first homework for a Computer Graphics course in University. <br />

The assignment was to create walls (some of them with holes for windows and doors) for at least 4 rooms based on the given template that was randomly generated for the different faculty numbers. <br />
Part of the assignment was to create two mandatory objects, different for every person, for me personally they were a guitar and a radiator. I decided to go beyond that and created furniture for all 4 rooms. <br />
